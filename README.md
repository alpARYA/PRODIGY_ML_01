# PRODIGY_ML_01
I have implemented a linear regression model for house price prediction based on Task-01: "Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms." The goal was to find the best-fit line (regression line) that predicts the house prices (dependent variable) based on the features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms (independent variables).
# DATASET
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
#Steps for Using the Dataset
1. Download all the four files from the website.
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Collab
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.
